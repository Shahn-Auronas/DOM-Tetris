DOM-Tetris
==========

A JavaScript implementation of Tetris.

Thanks DaltonRidenHour for helping me learn...

Updated the code to strict mode, some stylistic and syntatic JS changes. On the CSS and HTML front, more functionality 
and style changes...Still adding functionality to buttons to add music and game play.
